# Module: The History of Open Licensing and Creative Commons

### Why it Matters
> This module is designed to introduce you to the concept of open licenses for academic work and explore the history of Creative Commons as an organization and a set of licenses. You will learn about the advantages and disadvantages of each license and see examples of how they can be applied. 

### Learning Outcomes
In this module, you will:
- **Identify** the tensions between traditional copyright and the internet
- **Identify** the different Creative Commons licenses
- **Apply** open licenses to different works

## 1. Copyright and the Internet

Copyright applies to works of original authorship, which means works that are unique and not a copy of someone else’s work, and most of the time requires fixation in a tangible medium (written down, recorded, saved to your computer, etc.).

Copyright law establishes the basic terms of use that apply automatically to these original works. These terms give the creator or owner of copyright certain exclusive rights while also recognizing that users have certain rights to use these works without the need for a license or permission (1). 

Educators have always had a complicated relationship with copyright, mostly due to the complicated and ambigious definition of "fair use." But the internet has afforded significant new possibilities for educators to remix, remediate, and redistribute their own knowledge work and the work of others, and traditional copyright has come to represent a frustrating barrier for teachers who want to make as much knowledge as possible accessible to their students. Use the timeline exercise below to explore how the court cases of the 1990s brought this fundamental tension to a head.
